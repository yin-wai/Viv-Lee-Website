# Vivian Lee Dietitian website 

## Description

I dedicated this whole project to my friend, Vivian Lee.

The project was set up with a backend and frontend aspect of the whole website 

Backend Development

Backend development utilised sanity which provided a lot of ease with setting up the schema for the website. Using Sanity allows the website to make new schemas and include images to be updated on the website. The ‘hotspot’ selection for updating the image allows the user to crop the image according to how they want rather than just uploading the whole image. 

Frontend Development

Frontend development utilised React.JS as it is a competent and is more UI focused designed. 
I used BEM methodology (Block, Element, Modifier) to write a lot of the class name in this project, this is so that it is easy to read and you can search out which elements of the website are being changed. BEM methodology is also useful so that the project can allow 
Designing of the website utilises ‘sass’ as it is the most convenient for editing any changes and more easier to edit the website. SCSS has nesting property that makes it easier to edit when images are nested inside of ‘divs’ or ‘li’ etc.  

Framer-motion is also being used on the website

The website uses sanity as the bakcend element and it is set up so that the project ID and API token is privatised via a .env file. This ensures that the project is protected and that it is inaccessible to the individuals that looks at files of the frontend and backend elements of this website that have been published online.
